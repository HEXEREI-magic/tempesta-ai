      <h1>EUROPE EXTENDS SIESTA TO FULL WORKWEEK — PRODUCTIVITY MEASURED IN ESPRESSO SHOTS</h1>
      <h2>New Standard: If You Answered One Email and Ate Bread, You Worked</h2>

      <p><strong>MADRID, SPAIN</strong> — In a unanimous vote taken somewhere between a third espresso and a fourth nap, the European Union has officially extended the traditional afternoon siesta to cover the entire workweek. The legislation, dubbed the Work-Life Chill Act, redefines productivity as “existing near a laptop while emotionally unavailable.”</p>
      <p>“This isn’t about laziness,” said EU Commission spokesperson Luisa D’Luca, lounging on a sun-drenched balcony in socks and sandals. “It’s about preserving the delicate balance between burnout and baguette.”</p>
      <h2>What This Means for the Average Worker</h2>
      <p>Under the new guidelines, a typical workday now consists of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Waking up at 10:00 a.m. but not emotionally checking in until 1:00 p.m.</li>
        <li>Sending one (1) vaguely motivational email</li>
        <li>Staring at a spreadsheet while whispering “maybe tomorrow”</li>
        <li>A four-hour lunch involving olives, wine, and legally mandated staring into the distance</li>
        <li>A brief burst of work from 4:47 to 5:00 p.m.</li>
        <li>Immediate celebration for surviving the day</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Employees are now legally entitled to say “eh, mañana” up to three times per week without managerial consequence. Any boss who replies “circle back on this” during siesta hours can be fined €1,000 and publicly dunked in paella.</p>
      <h2>Economists Divided, But Mostly Sleepy</h2>
      <p>Critics worry the relaxed schedule will tank productivity, but supporters argue that productivity was already fake. “Look, most people were just toggling between tabs and pretending to type,” said sociologist Emil Sorensen. “Now we’re just being honest about it.”</p>
      <p>To measure economic output, the EU has adopted a new system: espresso-based productivity units (EPUs). One EPU equals one completed task powered by two shots of caffeine and blind optimism. The current EPU benchmark is 3.5 for France, 1.8 for Greece, and a respectable 9.2 for Italy, who were “already living like this tbh.”</p>
      <h2>Corporate Europe Tries to Adapt</h2>
      <p>In a panic, multinational corporations scrambled to update their employee portals with nap timers and ambient ocean sounds. Zoom has added a new “napping softly but present” status icon. Microsoft Word now autocorrects “urgent” to “maybe next week.”</p>
      <p>Google’s EU office has installed hammocks in meeting rooms. Amazon launched a pilot program where delivery drivers can take 20-minute “reflective snack breaks,” as long as they make philosophical eye contact with the Mediterranean Sea afterward.</p>
      <h2>Public Response: A Collective Exhale</h2>
      <p>Across the continent, morale skyrocketed. Outdoor cafes hit peak capacity. Wine sales soared. One German office worker was seen doing yoga in a suit and socks while listening to French jazz and holding a croissant “for balance.”</p>
      <p>“I finally feel alive,” said Sofia Rivas, a data analyst who hasn’t opened Slack in three days. “I haven’t accomplished anything, but I feel accomplished.”</p>
      <h2>What You Should Do Right Now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Submit your timecard with a doodle of a sleepy dog</li>
        <li>Politely decline meetings that don’t involve bread</li>
        <li>Answer emails in lowercase with a sigh emoji</li>
        <li>Build a shrine to espresso</li>
        <li>Update your résumé to include “proficient in rest” and “emotionally multilingual”</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Update: Entire Continent Ghosts Monday</h2>
      <p>In a coordinated act of peaceful protest, the EU has collectively forgotten that Mondays exist. Calendars now begin on Tuesday and end emotionally by Thursday.</p>
      <p>A second vote is already underway to redefine “weekend” as “everything not lunch.”</p>
      <p>Because in the New Europe, we don’t live to work. We sip, we nap, we vibe. 🇪🇺💤☕</p>
