    <h1>Texas Declares State of Emergency Over Mild Breeze</h1>

    <p><strong>AUSTIN, TEXAS —</strong> In a move officials described as “absolutely proportional to the threat of lightly rustled bangs,” Texas today declared a statewide <em>State of Emergency</em> after a <strong>7–11 mph</strong> gust tiptoed across a Buc-ee’s parking lot and made three lawn flamingos lean <em>ever so slightly</em> to the left.</p>

    <p>Governor Greg “Abundance of Caution” McCalister (not a real guy, chill) announced the order at a press conference where reporters struggled to keep their press passes from fluttering tragically.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“This is a light wind event—an LWE,” the Governor said, steadying his hair with both hands. “We will meet it with heavy bureaucracy.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>National Guard Deployed to Hold Down Patio Furniture</h2>
    <p>Texas activated 3,000 National Guard members to stabilize porch swings, pin down propane covers, and heroically return a runaway H-E-B receipt to its rightful minivan.</p>
    <p>“We train for this,” said Sgt. Maribel Ortiz, gripping a bungee cord like it was the last tortilla in the panadería. “If a wicker chair so much as scoots, we’re on it.”</p>

    <h2>Meteorologists Launch <em>WindTok</em>, Just To Keep Up</h2>
    <p>With Doppler radar now zoomed to detect “lightly persuasive breezes,” local meteorologists spun up <strong>WindTok</strong>, a TikTok subchannel offering 15-second updates like “It’s breezing… barely” and ASMR videos of wind chimes clinking in 2/4 time.</p>

    <h2>Power Companies Preemptively Cut Power To Prevent… Feeling Drafty?</h2>
    <p>ERCOT issued a statement urging residents to “conserve energy between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m., just in case the breeze becomes… <em>gustier</em>.” Rolling blackouts were described as “optional but spiritually centering.”</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“We don’t want the grid to feel overwhelmed by so many fans pivoting to face away from the window,” said an ERCOT spokesperson, standing in front of a windmill spinning lazily like it had a dinner reservation.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>H‑E‑B Shelves Emptied of Candles, Tortilla Chips, Emotional Support Queso</h2>
    <p>Within minutes of the emergency declaration, Texans flocked to H‑E‑B to panic-buy batteries, bread, and 48-packs of spring water for a meteorological event with the destructive potential of a sigh.</p>
    <p>“We were prepared for hurricane season,” said store manager Lila Nguyen. “We were not prepared for <em>slight hat displacement</em>.”</p>

    <h2>Scientists Reclassify Breeze as “Beaufort 2, But With Vibes”</h2>
    <p>The <strong>National Gentle Air Movement Administration (NGAMA)</strong>—formed this morning via emergency executive order—assigned the phenomenon a <strong>Beaufort Scale rating of 2</strong>, also known as “wind that makes leaves dance but not, like, <em>clubbingly</em>.”</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>“Technically this is a zephyr,” said Dr. Theo Swirl, gently misting a potted fern for drama. “But Texans don’t do anything small, including panic.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>TxDOT Urges Drivers to “Keep Both Hands on Your Cowboy Hat”</h2>
    <p>Electronic highway signs flashed warnings: <strong>“LIGHT BREEZE: SECURE YOUR HATS, LASH YOUR YETIS.”</strong> Troopers reported multiple slow-motion tumbleweeds, none of which posed “more than aesthetic risk.”</p>

    <h2>FEMA Introduces <em>Breeze Miles™</em> Loyalty Program</h2>
    <p>Residents earn points for every patio umbrella successfully lowered, every decorative porch sign rescued (“Bless This Home,” “Live, Laugh, Love”), and every panicked group text sent to family. Redeemable rewards include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One (1) weighted tablecloth clip</li>
      <li>A commemorative “I Survived the 2025 Texas Breeze” koozie</li>
      <li>Early access to next week’s “Humidity Watch”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Man Attempts to Lasso Breeze, Immediately Loses Hat</h2>
    <p>In Lubbock, rancher Clay “Whisper Wrangler” Jensen announced plans to “catch the wind and teach it manners.” He was last seen jogging down Highway 84 yelling, “It brushed my ear!” while his Stetson rolled away like a dignified tumbleweed.</p>

    <p>Authorities asked residents to “please stop trying to register their lawns as windbreaks for tax purposes.”</p>

    <h2>What Texans Are Urged To Do Right Now</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Secure outdoor cushions (or just pretend you did and go back inside)</li>
      <li>Charge devices in case TikTok goes down and you can’t upload your wind-sock POV</li>
      <li>Move lawn flamingos indoors; they’ve seen enough</li>
      <li>Speak calmly to your screen door, which may rattle a bit but is doing its best</li>
      <li>Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to name the breeze. It will go straight to its head</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Update: Breeze Downgraded to “A Suggestion”</h2>
    <p>By late afternoon, NGAMA downgraded the event to <strong>“a draftiness advisory,”</strong> recommending Texans simply <strong>“close the window, babe.”</strong> The Governor promised the state would remain on high alert “until the last wind chime stops being quirky.”</p>

    <p>If you’re still feeling rattled, experts suggest standing in a doorway and yelling, “IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?” at the air. It won’t help, but it’s very Texan.</p>
