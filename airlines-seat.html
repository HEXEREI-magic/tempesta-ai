    <p><strong>ATLANTA, GA</strong> — In a bid to maximize profits and minimize comfort, major airlines have introduced a new "Bring Your Own Seat" fare. Passengers are encouraged to bring folding chairs, beanbags, or "just stand and hold onto something."</p>
    <p>"It’s all about choice," said an airline spokesperson. "You can pay extra for a seat, or you can pay extra to not have one. Either way, you’re paying extra."</p>
    <p>Frequent flyers are already nostalgic for the days when legroom was measured in centimeters, not wishful thinking.</p>
