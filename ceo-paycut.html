    <p><strong>NEW YORK, NY</strong> — In a stirring act of selflessness, CEO Max Profitt announced a "voluntary" pay cut, reducing his annual compensation from $80 million to a mere $79.9 million. "We all have to tighten our belts," he said, before boarding his third helicopter of the day.</p>
    <p>The move has inspired workers nationwide to consider similar sacrifices, such as switching to generic seltzer or only using one streaming service at a time.</p>
    <p>Profitt’s board praised his "courage," then quietly voted themselves a bonus.</p>
