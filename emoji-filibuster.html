      <h2>Congress Enters New Era of Legislative Pictionary, Chaos Ensues</h2>

      <p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.</strong> — In an unprecedented moment of political theater and interpretive confusion, Senator Blake R. Spindle (I–NV) delivered a 14-hour filibuster composed entirely of emojis, turning the Senate floor into a real-time guessing game of vibes, feelings, and maybe policy(?).</p>
      <p>The address, which began at 9:00 a.m. with “👋📜🗳️” and ended at 11:07 p.m. with “🌈🫠✨🇺🇸,” has now been entered into the Congressional Record verbatim, thanks to a loophole in the Language Modernization Act of 2024 (also written partially in emoji, allegedly by accident).</p>
      <p>“I spoke from the heart,” Senator Spindle said afterward. “And also the thumbs. Mostly the thumbs.”</p>
      <h2>Translation: TBD</h2>
      <p>Legal scholars, cryptographers, and three Gen Z interns have been called in to decode the message, which includes repeated use of “😤📉💰😵” and a long stretch that appears to be a policy proposal or possibly a dream sequence:<br>“🦅➡️🏥⛓️🍔❓👀🧠💡🚫💣🍃🐍🍆🎯👽🚀”</p>
      <p>“It could be about healthcare reform,” said political linguist Dr. Mari Thom. “Or… eggplants.”</p>
      <h2>🫠 Emoji Now Legally Binding</h2>
      <p>In a shocking 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that “🫠” — the melting face emoji — now carries legal weight as an official expression of defeat, exhaustion, and “I cannot.” It may now be used to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>End legal arguments</li>
        <li>Excuse missed votes</li>
        <li>Replace a signature on emotionally draining documents</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Justice Kagan’s concurring opinion, written entirely in lowercase, simply stated: “we’re all tired.”</p>
      <h2>Senate Reaction: 😬</h2>
      <p>Reaction across the chamber was mixed. Sen. Lindsey Graham reportedly whispered, “I don’t speak pictogram,” while Sen. AOC posted “finally some transparency 🙌🔥” with a reaction video stitched over C-SPAN footage.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer attempted to respond in emoji and accidentally DM’d “🍆😳🏃‍♂️” to the entire chamber. He has since apologized and blamed autocorrect.</p>
      <h2>Capitol Hill Adapts</h2>
      <p>Congressional staffers are now being trained in Emoji-to-English policy analysis. Closed captioning on Senate broadcasts has been updated to include tone tags and TikTok subtitles like “/srs,” “/gen,” and “he’s literally just like me fr.”</p>
      <p>The Congressional Record is also launching a visual digest: “Scrolls, But Make It Stickers.”</p>
      <h2>What You Should Do Right Now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn how to write a tax amendment in emoji</li>
        <li>Replace your legal signature with “🤷‍♀️🧾✨” for plausible deniability</li>
        <li>Prepare for political ads with zero words and 100% reaction GIFs</li>
        <li>Petition your senator using “😭😭😭 pls 🙏🇺🇸✨”</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Update: Next Filibuster Rumored to Be Interpreted Dance</h2>
      <p>Senator Spindle teased that his next policy stand will be “just vibes and jazz hands.” C-SPAN confirmed it will air live in 4K with interpretive emoji overlays.</p>
      <p>One thing is certain: the future of politics is now being written in tiny cartoon faces, and somehow, it’s still easier to understand than the actual bills.</p>
