      <h1>UN ISSUES STRONGLY WORDED VIBE CHECK; WORLD PROMISES TO “DO BETTER, FOR REAL THIS TIME”</h1>
      <h2>Diplomatic Effort Includes Group Text, Mindful Breathing, and a Global “We Good?”</h2>

      <p><strong>GENEVA, SWITZERLAND</strong> — In a historic session held entirely over Zoom, the United Nations issued what diplomats are calling a “strongly worded vibe check” on the entire planet, citing rising global tension, ecosystem burnout, and what one delegate described as “just… a general sense that everyone’s being kinda weird lately.”</p>
      <p>The resolution, titled “We Noticed the Energy Is Off (Resolution 420/69),” passed with 187 votes in favor, three against, and one abstention from a nation currently ghosting the international community.</p>
      <h2>“We’ve Tried Sanctions. We’ve Tried Summits. Now We’re Trying Vibes.”</h2>
      <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (visibly wearing sweatpants just off-screen) addressed the General Assembly in a speech described as “equal parts TED Talk and sad group project debrief.”</p>
      <p>“The planet is low-key spiraling,” Guterres said, sipping from a “World’s Okayest Diplomat” mug. “The vibes are rancid. The group chat is dry. We’re asking every nation to look inward and ask: ‘Is it me?’”</p>
      <h2>A Multi-Pronged Strategy of Emotional Intervention</h2>
      <p>The resolution outlines several immediate actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mandatory journaling for all world leaders</li>
        <li>A quarterly full-Earth meditation (timezone chaos TBD)</li>
        <li>UN-sanctioned meme therapy</li>
        <li>The formation of a new department: Global Aura Alignment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Delegates were also encouraged to stop “speaking in passive aggression” and instead “say what you mean, but gently.” A representative from Canada wept softly.</p>
      <h2>Mixed Reactions from Global Leaders</h2>
      <p>U.S. Ambassador Samantha Lake called the vibe check “long overdue,” noting the country’s current mood is “somewhere between 2016 and a burnt-out ring light.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the U.K. offered to lead the new task force for Planetary Energy Healing, citing decades of practice pretending things are fine when they absolutely are not.</p>
      <p>Russia initially rejected the motion, saying “we do not recognize the concept of vibe,” but later agreed to participate after being sent a curated playlist titled “Feel It to Heal It (Diplomatic Lo-Fi Beats).”</p>
      <h2>Influencer Nation-States Jump on the Trend</h2>
      <p>In a surprise move, Monaco live-streamed their delegation journaling in a candlelit room while playing ocean sounds. “We stan accountability,” said Princess Ella-Leigh of TikTokia (an unrecognized micronation based entirely on vibes and curated aesthetics).</p>
      <h2>UN Deploys Certified Vibe Checkers</h2>
      <p>To enforce compliance, the UN has trained a small team of Vibe Check Officers—neutral third-party therapists in cardigans—tasked with visiting capitals, assessing the energy of the room, and saying things like, “Let’s just sit with that for a minute.”</p>
      <p>Failure to pass a vibe check may result in “time-outs from international summits,” or being benched during climate discussions.</p>
      <h2>What You Should Do Right Now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Light a candle for the ozone layer</li>
        <li>Text your geopolitical nemesis “u good?”</li>
        <li>Do a 5-minute grounding exercise while reading your country's GDP stats</li>
        <li>Acknowledge your role in the group project of existence without making it weird</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Update: World Immediately Regresses After Reading One Comment Section</h2>
      <p>Within hours of the resolution’s passage, global mood dropped back to “tense but trying” after diplomats glanced at Twitter replies. The UN clarified that “vibe recovery is not linear” and asked the world to “try again tomorrow after a nap.”</p>
      <p>If nothing else, experts agree the vibe check may not fix the world… but at least now we’re talking about it.</p>
      <p>And talking is the first step to healing or at least sending better memes.</p>
