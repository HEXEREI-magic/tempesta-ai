    <p><strong>SILICON VALLEY, CA</strong> — In a move that has left both tech insiders and lunch enthusiasts speechless, startup "CrumbChain" is selling partially eaten sandwiches as blockchain-certified NFTs 2.0. Each bite is unique, non-fungible, and comes with a certificate of authenticity signed in mayonnaise.</p>
    <p>"We’re disrupting lunch," said CEO Chip Rye. "Why finish your sandwich when you can tokenize every bite?" Early investors are reportedly hungry for more, though some admit they’re just here for the free snacks at pitch meetings.</p>
    <p>Analysts warn the market may be overhyped, but CrumbChain insists the only thing that will crash is your blood sugar.</p>
