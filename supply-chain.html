      <h1>GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN SAYS IT’S “IN A SITUATIONSHIP” WITH TIME, WON’T DEFINE THE RELATIONSHIP</h1>
      <h2>Logistics Industry Ghosts Deadlines, Sends Mixed Signals</h2>

      <p><strong>NEW YORK</strong> — The global supply chain, long known for its unpredictability and occasional mood swings, has officially admitted it’s “in a situationship” with time — a messy, undefined relationship characterized by flaky delivery estimates, last-minute delays, and just enough communication to keep everyone hooked.</p>
      <p>In an exclusive statement released via courier that arrived two weeks late, the World Logistics Federation said, “Look, we care about deadlines. We really do. But sometimes the ocean waves are dramatic, or a container ship just needs ‘space,’ you know? It’s complicated.”</p>
      <h2>Shipments Left on Read, Containers Ghosted</h2>
      <p>Business owners and consumers alike have grown accustomed to cryptic updates such as “Your package is currently in transit (somewhere).” Meanwhile, port workers report seeing containers spontaneously vanish and reappear like exes sliding into DMs at 3 a.m.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes we get a tracking update, sometimes we don’t,” said warehouse manager Tanya Lee. “It’s like dating someone who never texts back but always posts cryptic stories.”</p>
      <h2>Experts Diagnose Chronic Commitment Issues</h2>
      <p>Supply chain analyst Max Porter explained, “The system suffers from chronic commitment issues to deadlines. Global events, labor shortages, and those annoying tariffs keep pushing it into a perpetual ‘it’s complicated’ status.”</p>
      <p>“I mean, the chain wants to show up on time,” Porter continued, “but the allure of unpredictability is just too strong.”</p>
      <h2>Consumers Left Swiping Right on Alternative Solutions</h2>
      <p>In response, many shoppers have turned to local artisanal makers or started DIY projects with duct tape and optimism. Amazon’s new slogan, “Delivering Eventually,” has been met with mixed feelings but at least feels honest.</p>
      <p>E-commerce platforms now offer a “mystery delivery date” option, marketed as “the thrill of suspense with none of the commitment.”</p>
      <h2>Supply Chain Sends Mixed Signals</h2>
      <p>Some days, containers arrive early, sparking viral celebrations on Twitter. Other days, entire shipments languish in ports like someone ignoring your texts but liking your photos.</p>
      <p>“It’s like we’re on a break,” said one freight forwarder anonymously. “Maybe we’ll come back together next quarter, maybe not. Let’s just see where the wind takes us.”</p>
      <h2>What You Should Do Right Now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Manage your expectations accordingly (low, but hopeful)</li>
        <li>Build an altar of patience, complete with candles and shipping labels</li>
        <li>Consider pre-ordering everything, all the time</li>
        <li>Practice your “it’s fine” face for customer service calls</li>
        <li>Stock up on snacks for the inevitable waiting game</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Update: Supply Chain Adds ‘It’s Not You, It’s Me’ to FAQ</h2>
      <p>In a recent FAQ update, the supply chain reassured customers: “We’re working on ourselves, but it’s a process. Thanks for sticking around, even if we’re kinda flaky.”</p>
      <p>As consumers everywhere wait for packages that may or may not come, experts say one thing is clear: the global supply chain might never fully commit—but it sure keeps the drama going.</p>
