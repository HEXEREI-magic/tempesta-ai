      <h1>CONGRESS PASSES 1,200-PAGE BILL NO ONE READ, NOT EVEN THE PDF PREVIEW</h1>
      <h2>Lawmakers Vote After Glancing at the Cover and Vaguely Nodding</h2>
      <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1464983953574-0892a716854b?auto=format&fit=crop&w=800&q=80" alt="Congress Bill" style="max-width:100%;border-radius:8px;margin:1.5em 0;" />
      <p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.</strong> — In a display of bipartisan confusion and legislative vibes, Congress has passed a sweeping 1,200-page bill titled “The Comprehensive Reform Omnibus Recovery Stabilization Act and Also Some Random Stuff (C.R.O.R.S.A.A.S.R.S.)” without reading a single full sentence—let alone the PDF preview.</p>
      <p>The bill, which was emailed to lawmakers at 2:43 a.m. with the subject line “IMPORTANT—read before voting!” was passed by a vote of 378–41, with most representatives admitting they clicked “Yes” while waiting for coffee or refreshing Threads.</p>
      <h2>“I Thought This Was About School Lunches”</h2>
      <p>“I skimmed the first paragraph,” confessed Rep. Lisa Connors (D–OR), “but then my laptop auto-updated and I took it as a sign.” Sen. Mark Dellis (R–IN) claimed he tried to open the document, “but it said something about Acrobat needing permission to download fonts and I just… couldn’t.”</p>
      <p>The bill reportedly includes infrastructure funding, tax breaks for alpaca farms, mandatory Wi-Fi in cornfields, a TikTok literacy program for senators over 60, and a federal recognition of “vibe fatigue” as a workplace disability.</p>
      <h2>Clerks Confirm No One Scrolled Past Page 3</h2>
      <p>Capitol aides confirm that no member of Congress accessed more than 2% of the document. “We saw a lot of Command-F for ‘pork,’ ‘defense,’ and ‘Taylor Swift,’” said Clerk Adira Salazar, “but no actual reading.”</p>
      <p>One congressperson printed the bill out, dropped it on the floor, and called it “a filibuster in paperback form.”</p>
      <h2>The Highlights, Apparently</h2>
      <p>Reporters who did read the whole thing (under duress) found several eyebrow-raising provisions, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A $2 million grant for a nationwide “chill zone” research initiative</li>
        <li>A clause legally defining “meh” as a federal mood</li>
        <li>Emergency funds for states experiencing “emotional humidity”</li>
        <li>A requirement that all future bills include an emoji summary</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>AI-Generated Section Raises Eyebrows and Existential Dread</h2>
      <p>A 47-page section on trade tariffs was discovered to be written entirely by AI. It contains 17 instances of the phrase “global spaghetti pipeline” and one heartfelt haiku about maritime logistics. No one has claimed responsibility.</p>
      <h2>President Signs It Anyway, For the Plot</h2>
      <p>President Biden signed the bill into law with a statement that simply read, “I trust the vibes.” The pen he used was later auctioned for $23,000 to fund mental health resources for exhausted interns.</p>
      <h2>What You Should Do Right Now</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Try reading page 457. If you can survive that, you qualify for hazard pay</li>
        <li>Ask your representative what they voted for. Watch them panic</li>
        <li>Brace for sudden changes to corn subsidies, crypto taxes, or time zones</li>
        <li>Print it out and use it as a standing desk</li>
        <li>Check if your city was accidentally renamed</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Update: Congress Now Considering a 3,000-Page Bill That’s Just a JPEG of a Thumbs-Up</h2>
      <p>Working title: The “Trust Us, Babe” Act.</p>
      <p>As lawmakers continue to legislate with vibes over vision, experts warn this may set a dangerous precedent. Or maybe it won’t. No one’s sure. Because no one read the part that explains that.</p>
